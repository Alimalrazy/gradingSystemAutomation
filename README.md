The AI-Powered Grading Automation project is a web application that uses Google's Gemini AI to grade student answers. The application, built with Python and Streamlit, features an intuitive interface where users input a question and an answer. The AI then evaluates the answer based on criteria such as accuracy, completeness, and clarity, providing a score from 0-10.
